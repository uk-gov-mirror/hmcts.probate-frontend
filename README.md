# Probate Frontend

This is the frontend application for the Probate Personal Applicants online service. The service provides a clear interface for citizens, presented as sequence of HTML 5 web pages designed to GDS Service Design guidelines, so that they can apply for Probate online. The service provides functionality for both single and multiple applicant journeys.

The Frontend Application delegates a number of backend logic to the underlying services, including Orchestrator, Business and Submit services.
